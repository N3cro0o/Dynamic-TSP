# Dynamic-TSP
Repository used for university project about testing different TSP algorithms. The used parameter to check efficiency of each algorithm is the time of finding the shortest path.

## Already implemented algoritms:
* Brute-force algorithm
* Held-Karp dynamic algorithm
* Personal take on Held-Karp algorithm

## Dynamic algorithms
Repository has two takes on dynamic solution. One of them is the classic Held-Karp algorithm based on bitmasks to store optimal path. The second one uses an array of structs to store the permutations, target and the shortest path. The latter algorithm was made to check different method of implementation so the given solution is far from desired.
